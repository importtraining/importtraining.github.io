<h1>Python for Data Analysis</h1>

<h2>Code Dojo</h2>

<p>Nick runs the <a href="http://ntoll.org/article/how-to-run-an-awesome-code-dojo">London Python Code Dojo</a>, a monthly event for Python programmers of all abilities to get together, solve problems with Python, and have fun.</p>

<p>The London Dojo begins with people suggesting ideas for a problem to solve over the course of the evening.  Everybody then votes, and an idea is chosen.  People are randomly split into groups of four of five, usually containing a mix of beginners and more experienced Python programmers.  Over the course of the next hour and a half, each group works on a solution to the problem, and at the end we come together for a show-and-tell, to share our solutions and to see how other groups have approached the same problem.</p>

<p>Groups self-organise, and different groups find different ways of working, but but it's important that everybody has a go at writing some code.  Often members of a group share a laptop, and take it in turn to write the smallest amount of code to make progress on the solution.  That's what we're going to do today.</p>

<p>In this exercise, we're going to work together as a group to write a progam that plays <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>.</p>
